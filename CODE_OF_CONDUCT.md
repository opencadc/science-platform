# Code of Conduct

OpenCADC is the GitHub Organization used by the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre (CADC) and the Canadian Advanced Network for Astronomical Research (CANFAR).

## Introduction

This code of conduct applies to all on-line spaces where internal and external contributors interact with OpenCADC software, including Slack, discord, GitHub, Jira, Confluence, Service Manager (Atlassian), email, and any other communication channels used.

## Specific Guidelines

We strive to:

1. <b>Be open.</b> We invite anyone to participate in OpenCADC. We prefer to use public methods of communication for project-related messages, unless discussing something sensitive. This applies to messages for help or project-related support, too; not only is a public support request much more likely to result in an answer to a question, it also makes enables the correction of inadvertent mistakes made when answering a query.

1. <b>Be empathetic, welcoming, friendly, and patient.</b> We work together to resolve conflicts, assume good intentions, and do our best to act in an empathetic fashion. We may all experience some frustration from time to time, but we do not allow frustration to result in a personal attack. It is unproductive for people to feel uncomfortable or threatened. We should be respectful when dealing with other OpenCADC members participants as well as with people outside of OpenCADC.

1. <b>Be collaborative.</b> Other people will use our work, and we in turn depend on the work of others. When we make something for the benefit of OpenCADC, we are willing to explain to others how it works, so they can build on the work to make it even better. Any decision we make will affect users and colleagues, and we take those consequences seriously when making decisions.

1. <b>Be inquisitive.</b> Nobody knows everything! Asking questions early avoids many problems later, so we encourage questions, although we may redirect them to the appropriate forum. Those who receive a question should be responsive and helpful, within the context of our shared goal of improving OpenCADC artifacts.

1. <b>Be careful in the words that we choose.</b> Whether we are participating as professionals or volunteers, we value professionalism in all interactions, and take responsibility for our own speech. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behaviour are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:

    1. Violent threats or language directed against another person.

    1. Sexist, racist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.

    1. Posting sexually explicit or violent material.

    1. Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").

    1. Sharing private content, such as emails sent privately or non-publicly, or from unlogged forums such as IRC channel history.

    1. Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.

    1. Unwelcome sexual attention.

    1. Excessive or unnecessary profanity.

    1. Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

    1. Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour.

1. <b>Be concise.</b> Keep in mind that, over time, hundreds or thousands of people will read what you write. Writing a short email means people can understand the conversation as efficiently as possible. Short emails should always strive to be empathetic, welcoming, friendly and patient. When a long explanation is necessary, consider adding a summary at the top of the message.

    Try to bring new ideas to a conversation so that each email adds something unique to the thread, keeping in mind that the rest of the thread still contains the other messages with arguments that have already been made.

    Try to stay on topic, especially in discussions that are already fairly long.

## Diversity Statement

1. We embrace diversity and hold ourselves responsible for creating an environment in which we all want to work.

1. The diversity of our people and the ideas they generate are the source of our innovation.

1. We respect human dignity and the value of every person by:

    1. Treating every person with respect and fairness.

    1. Valuing diversity and the benefit of combining the unique qualities and strengths inherent in a diverse workforce.

    1. Helping to create and maintain safe and healthy workplaces that are free from harassment and discrimination.

    1. Working together in a spirit of openness, honesty and transparency that encourages engagement, collaboration and respectful communication.
