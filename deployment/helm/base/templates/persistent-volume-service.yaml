# This is a sample PersistentVolume that is expected to be present.  It can be anything, so long as it can be bound by a PersistentVolumeClaim
# when Skaha is installed.  This is done by matching th labels.  The intent is that a Cluster Administrator will have a PersistentVolume setup,
# and will direct deployers on what label to use to bind to it.
# This will be used by the User Sessions when starting up to gain access to the shared Storage with the Skaha service.
