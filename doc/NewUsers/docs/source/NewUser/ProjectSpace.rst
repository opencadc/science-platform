Setting up a Project Space
==========================

What is a Project Space?
------------------------
Users can work with files in two different main directories.  The
first is their personal home directory, found in ``/home/[username]``.
The second is within a project directory, found in ``/project/[project_name]``.
These project directories provide a space where files can easily be shared
and analyzed with collaborators.  Using the :ref:`groupmanagement` tools,
users can designate a list of others who can access their files.  These
designated individuals, if also given an account on the Science Portal,
may interact with the files using the various session types available.  These
features enable truly collaborative work, e.g., allowing a team to
jointly reduce large quantities of data from a project.

How to Request a Project Space
------------------------------
In order to request a project space, you will need to have a name for
the space (the name of the project directory).  As with home directories,
the default diskspace allocation is 200GB.  If you anticipate needing more
than this (e.g., working with large datasets such as from ALMA or the VLA),
you will need an estimate of the amount of diskspace that you will need.
(Requests to change the diskspace allocation at a later date are also
possible.)  Once you have this information, if you are on the Slack 
workspace, the easiest way to request a project space is to post the 
request there, with a note to Kevin Casteels.  Alternatively, you can
email the request to ``support@canfar.net``


How to Give Collaborators Access
--------------------------------

Collaborators will require a free CADC account in order to be added as
people with designated access to the project space files.  A CADC
account can be requested at 
https://www.cadc-ccda.hia-iha.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/en/auth/request.html
If your collaborators only wish to download the files and analyze them
on their own computers, this step is sufficient; they can access the
files on the web at 
https://www.canfar.net/storage/arc/list/project/[project_name] or use
the :ref:`VOS Tools <vostools>` to download them.
If your collaborators wish to work on the files directly on the
Science Portal, they will need to request an account on the system,
either through emailing ``support@canfar.net`` or you can post a 
request on the slack channel on their behalf (please include their
CADC username and the project that you'd like them to have access to). 

Finally, you can manage which users are able to access your files on the
project space using the :ref:`group management tools <groupmanagement>`.
