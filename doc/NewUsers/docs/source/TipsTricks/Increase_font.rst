Increase Font Size of Desktop Containers
========================================

Some users may find the default font size for containers in the Desktop
session (such as the terminal) too small to easily read.

The font size can be easily adjusted by holding the control key and 
clicking anywhere in the terminal.  This brings up a pop-up menu that
allows you to select a different font size.
