Starting CASA
=================================

Once you have :ref:`launched a Desktop session<launch_desktop>`, 
it is straightforward to run CASA in a terminal.

To start a CASA-enabled terminal, first click on the 'Applications' menu
at the top left corner of your screen

Click through the 'AstroSoftware' and main CASA version to select the
specific version that you want to use.  Every version of CASA back
to CASA 3.4.0 is available (this is the version of CASA which is
tied to the scripts distributed with ALMA Cycle 0 data on the archive;
see link `here <https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=Updating_a_script_to_work_with_CASA_4.2>`_)

**NOTE: This screenshot will
need to be revised once the menu is finalzed and 'ARCADE' has been
removed**

Clicking on your prefered version of CASA will open a terminal in which
you can run CASA in the standard manner (typing either 'casa' or
'casa --pipeline' depending on the mode you wish to use).
**[NB: need to fix formatting so spaces between two dashes shows up]**

You can open a regular (non-CASA) terminal by double-clicking the 'terminal'
icon at the lower left side of the screen.  Note that each terminal has
a label on top which denotes what type of terminal it is (i.e., a plain
terminal or the CASA version that is enabled).  Only basic linux commands are
recognized in the CASA terminals, so it is preferable to use a non-CASA
terminal for all regular linux uses.
