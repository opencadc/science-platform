Transfer File Into Notebook Session
===================================

Smaller files can be uploaded into a Notebook session easily in two different
ways.  These are outlined in turn below.

Directly Upload the File
------------------------

Once you have navigated into your directory of interest using the browser
in the left-hand side, click the upward-pointing arrow on the top menu
bar.

This will bring up a window that will let you select the file you wish
to upload.  Click the 'Open' button as usual to confirm your choice of
files.

Success!  Your file is now visible in the browser, and would also be accessible
in the same location in a Desktop or a CARTA session.

Copy-Paste Text
---------------

Alternatively, you can copy and paste text directly into a a file within 
your Notebook session.  This might be prefered if, for example, you want 
to copy a snippet of code into an already existing file in your session.
Start by opening up a terminal by double-clicking on the icon.

This opens a terminal on the right hand side of the screen which you can
interact with as usual.  In the example shown, the text editor vi is
being initiated on the command line.

On your local computer, you would select and copy the text of interest.

You can then paste this text into a text editor in the terminal.

Once the file is saved, it is accessible from the file browser in the current
directory, and would be visible in a Desktop or a CARTA session as well.
